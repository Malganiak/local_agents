      "Final Answer: The Pythagorean theorem is a mathematical principle that states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In simpler terms, it means that if you have a right triangle, and you know the lengths of any two of its sides, you can find the length of the third side using this theorem.\n",
